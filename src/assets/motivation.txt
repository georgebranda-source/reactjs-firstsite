Much of Canada's political history has been characterized by questions of identity as a result of its unique position in the world economy. Once deeply tied to the British empire, the United States' gradually pulled Canada into its own economic and cultural orbit. Nation-building politicians like John Diefenbaker and Pierre Eliot Trudeau argued for the preservation of Canada's independence by diversifying its trade away from the United States. However, Canada's reliance on the United States only grew, with the neoliberal era proving it a lucrative ally.

In 2025, Donald Trump's tariff threats and '51st State' assertions showed that overreliance on American trade has silently corroded Canada's claim to independence, reopening old debates about national identity. The result has been multipartisan efforts to strengthen Canadian sovereignty by diversifying its trading partners. Mark Carney's January 2026 visit to China, which led to reduced tariff rates between the two countries, is one example. Considering the importance of Canada's trade relationships to its national independence, this site intends to document these changes in as close to real-time as possible.

This site's graph page was created because Statistics Canada's native visualizers lack certain features that are needed in order to clearly compare Canada's trade relationships with its biggest partners, such as a normalized view and multiple-country overlays. Other online visualizers, such as those provided by the World Bank, provide more comprehensive tools but can be cumbersome to use. The Canadian International Trade Dashboard aims to provide them in a simple, easy-to-use format.
